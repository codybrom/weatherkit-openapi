An OpenAPI 3 specification for Apple's WeatherKit REST API with interactive Swagger UI documentation.

ðŸ”— **SwaggerUI:** [https://codybrom.github.io/weatherkit-openapi/](https://codybrom.github.io/weatherkit-openapi/)

## Why This Exists

Apple provides a powerful WeatherKit REST API but hasn't published an official OpenAPI/Swagger specification. This project fills that gap by offering:

- Complete API endpoint documentation
- Request/response schema definitions
- Interactive UI for exploring the API structure
- Reference for client code generation

> [!CAUTION]
> **Privacy Note:** The Swagger UI interface runs entirely client-side. Your weather data, coordinates, and JWT tokens never leave your device. Due to CORS restrictions, direct API calls from the Swagger UI won't work - it's designed for documentation purposes only.

## Authentication

All WeatherKit endpoints require JWT authentication with ES256 signature.

```plaintext
Authorization: Bearer <your_jwt_token>
```

For details on generating valid tokens, see [Apple's authentication documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/weatherkitrestapi/request_authentication_for_weatherkit_rest_api).

## API Coverage

This specification covers all endpoints of the Apple WeatherKit REST API:

- Weather data by location (latitude/longitude)
- Current weather conditions
- Daily forecasts
- Hourly forecasts
- Weather alerts
- Historical weather data
- Weather dataset availability

## Usage Examples

### Client Code Generation

You can use this OpenAPI specification to generate client code in various languages:

```bash
# Using OpenAPI Generator
openapi-generator-cli generate -i openapi.yaml -g python -o ./python-client

# Using Swagger Codegen
swagger-codegen generate -i openapi.yaml -l javascript -o ./js-client
```

### API Exploration

The provided Swagger UI lets you explore:

- Available endpoints
- Required parameters
- Expected responses
- Schema definitions
